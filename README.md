# **NEWSFEED ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS IN TABLEAU PROJECT**

## Overview
This project entails a comprehensive analysis of user engagement with the 365Data Science platform's Newsfeed feature. Leveraging Tableau's advanced data visualization capabilities, we examined user interaction patterns over a five-month period, from January 1, 2023, to May 31, 2023. The primary objective was to uncover actionable insights to enhance user engagement and optimize the Newsfeed's performance.

## **Project Objectives**
- Analyze User Interaction Patterns: Develop visualizations to understand how users engage with different types of Newsfeed posts.
- Identify Popular Post Subtypes: Determine which post subtypes resonate most with the audience in terms of likes and comments.
- Assess User Activity Levels: Evaluate the proportion of users actively engaging with the Newsfeed through likes, comments, or manual posts.
- Provide Recommendations: Based on the analysis, suggest actionable strategies to enhance user engagement with the Newsfeed.

## **Data Sources**
The analysis utilized two primary datasets:
1. newsfeed_project_1.csv: Contains detailed information on individual Newsfeed posts, including:
Post ID
Post Date
Post Subtype
Number of Likes
Number of Comments

2. newsfeed_project_2.csv: Contains aggregated engagement data, including:
Total Active Users
Users Who Commented
Users Who Liked a Post
Users Who Made a Post
Total Visitors to the Newsfeed

## **Visualizations Created**
To achieve the project objectives, the following visualizations were developed:
1. Dual Axis Chart: Displays the monthly count of posts alongside the average likes per post, providing insights into content popularity and user engagement trends over time.
2. Bar Charts: Three horizontal bar charts ranking post subtypes by:
- Total Number of Posts
- Total Likes Received
- Total Comments Received
3. User Activity Bar Chart: Illustrates user engagement levels by showing the number of visitors, active users, and those who engaged through likes, comments, or manual posts.

## **Key Insights**
Post Subtype Engagement: Automated posts, such as 'Course Certificate' and 'Career Track Certificate,' received higher average likes compared to manual 'Text Posts.'
User Interaction: A significant portion of users visited the Newsfeed, but a smaller percentage actively engaged through likes, comments, or posts.
Recommendations
Enhance Manual Post Visibility: Encourage users to create more manual 'Text Posts' by highlighting them in the Newsfeed, as they foster community engagement.
Promote Active Participation: Implement features that incentivize users to like, comment, and post, thereby increasing overall engagement.
How to Access the Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard for this project is published on Tableau Public and can be accessed here.

## **Conclusion**
This analysis provides valuable insights into user engagement with the 365Data Science platform's Newsfeed feature. By understanding interaction patterns and identifying areas for improvement, the platform can implement strategies to enhance user experience and foster a more engaged community.

Note: This project was conducted using Tableau Public 2023.1.
